<!-- 
This file defines Jinja Macros that can be imported into any template by adding:

    include "macros/form.html" 

inside of curly braces with % on either side. TO GET PROPER STYLING, you will
need to import the associated CSS file located in /static/macros. 

To define a form, inside of curly braces with % on either side, put:

    call form('xyz', 'abc', '123', '789')

where xyz should be replaced with the ID of the form. ABC can be replaced with
the name of a class to customize the styling, though this is optional. 123 must
be replaced with the enctype of the form (most commonly, this will be 
application/x-www-form-urlencoded). 789 should be replaced with the name of the
function to be called when the form is submitted, though this is optional. 
A call must end with:

    endcall

inside of curly braces with a % on either side. Inside of the call/endcall block, 
you can use the same structure to call another macro in this file. There are
macros specific to each input type. To accss a form with JavaScript, access by its
ID. To access a field within a form, access the form, then append:

    .querySelector("#xyz")

where xyz should be replaced with the name of the field.
